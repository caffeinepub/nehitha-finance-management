Adjust the container/grid classes so the remaining Customer Portal card is centered and uses a single-card layout (e.g., remove md:grid-cols-2 and reduce max width accordingly) while continuing to compose existing shadcn/ui Card/Button components without editing files under frontend/src/components/ui. Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
