The Aadhar and PAN fields have been removed from the customer request form (CustomerRequestPage.tsx), form validation no longer checks for these fields, and the WhatsApp message template (whatsapp.ts) has been updated to exclude both fields. The changes maintain form layout consistency and preserve the consent checkbox functionality as specified in the constraints.",
